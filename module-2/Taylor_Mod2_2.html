<p class="intro">
My name is Kendall Taylor.  I was born in South Korea, and was adopted when I was 4 months old. I currently live in Omaha, Nebraska and I am working on my second degree in Software Development.</p>
<p><span class="sentence">In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family and kids.</span>  I have 2 step children who are 4 and 8.  We love to go to the Zoo and Children's Museum.  We spend a lot of time exploring new things and finding new interests.</p>
<p>I currently work as a Director in Childcare.  I have been in this position for 10 years and love being a part of the children's learning and development experiences. During my time working with this company, I have created special bonds with the families in my care, and have found this position to be very rewarding.</p>
<p>One of my favorite things to do is travel and experience other locations.  I love to try new foods and visit different landmarks and cities.   My favorite place to travel has been Hawaii because the scenery and views are beautiful.</p>
