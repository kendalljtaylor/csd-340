<h2>Three Little Pigs</h2>
<p>Once upon a time, there were <span id="first">____</span>.  When they grew up, they split up to create homes of their own. </p>
<p> The first pig build a house of <span id="second">____</span>.  The second pig built a house out of <span id="third">____</span>.  The last pig built their house out of bricks.</p>
<p>One day, a <span id="fourth">____</span> wolf came to the first pigs house and blew it down.  The first pig ran to the second pigs house.  The wolf followed and blew the second pigs house down.  They both ran to the third pigs house.  The third pigs house was too strong for the wolf, and he ran away</p>
